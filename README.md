# ü§ñ It is a Robot!
Welcome to my very first 3D project in **Blender** ‚Äì and yes, *It is a Robot!*

This mechanical buddy was built from scratch and is ready to show off its style, structure, and sweet dance moves.

## üõ†Ô∏è It is a Robot ‚Äì A cool journey!

Creating this robot was my introduction to Blender. I did this project as part of a lecture at Aalen University
where I was studying. Here's how the process went:

### üß© Building the Bot
From basic shapes to detailed geometry - and of course, creating a little bit of mess on the way is just part of it.

- I started with **low poly modeling**
- Created a lot of small components for detailing
- Went to a much more **high poly design**
- Sculpted the body for the **high poly finish**
- Had a lot of fun and learned a ton along the way!

### üé® Texturing & Shading

Using Blender's Shader Editor, I tried creating a clean and colorful look.
I also played a lot with lighting and reflections.

üì∏ Eventually I ended up with something like this:

## üé¨ It is a Robot ‚Äì With Animations!

And then... it moved!  
Rigging the robot with bones and controllers opened up the next level.
Now this beast is on the way - you better dont stop it!

Using the rig, I created **three key animations**:

- **Running** ‚Äì on the way
- **Idle** ‚Äì just chilling, waiting for some input
- **Dancing** ‚Äì because why not?

- **Running** ‚Äì on the way üèÉ

   The running animation was my first animation I created with the rig. It was actually quite the challenge! The result looks quite humanoid.

- **Idle** ‚Äì just chilling, waiting for some input üí§

  Here I was able to really live out my creative side again. The animation actually consists of a series of chained, independent sub-animations.

- **Dancing** ‚Äì because why not? üï∫

   If you encounter me in the disco, this is actually quite close to how you would see me dancing

## üé¨ What a journey!

I had a great time doing that beast! And of course I spent waaay to many nights on it, but the results are really cool!
I really enjoyed learning to model, texture, rig and animate 3d models! This was the first time i was using Blender, and i am already dreaming of more bots.
