🎉 First release of the Blender Robot project – built during my studies at Aalen University.

This release includes three downloadable packages:

---

### 🧩 Blender_Robot_SingleParts.blend.zip
Contains all individual components of the robot as separate objects –
great for customizing the robot or reusing small components like screws for another project

> 🛠️ Use this if you want to modify or reuse single parts of the robot.

---

### 🦾 Blender_Robot.blend.zip
Complete robot model in a single `.blend` file. Includes high-poly geometry, materials, rig and animations.

> 🎨 Best choice if you want to see and use the final version of the robot in Blender.

---

### 📦 Blender_Robot_fbx.zip
Exported `.fbx` version of the full robot – useful for importing into other tools like Unity, Unreal Engine, Maya, etc.

> 🧪 Use this file for importing into game engines like unity
